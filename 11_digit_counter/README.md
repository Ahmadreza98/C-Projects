## Features

- Accepts an integer input from the user
- Automatically handles negative numbers
- Uses a `while` loop to count digits
- Prints the digit count clearly in the terminal
- Simple and efficient implementation

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:
