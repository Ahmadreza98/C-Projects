# Reverse a Number in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that reverses the digits of an integer entered by the user. It demonstrates the use of loops, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts an integer input from the user
- Handles negative numbers correctly
- Uses a `while` loop to reverse the digits
- Prints the reversed number clearly in the terminal
- Simple and efficient implementation

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc reverse_number.c -o reverse_number
