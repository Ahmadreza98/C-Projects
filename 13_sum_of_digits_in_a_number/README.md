# Sum of Digits in a Number in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that calculates the **sum of the digits** of an integer entered by the user. It demonstrates loops, arithmetic operations, handling negative numbers, and basic input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts an integer input from the user
- Handles negative numbers correctly
- Uses a `while` loop to sum the digits
- Prints the sum clearly in the terminal
- Simple and efficient implementation

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc sum_digits.c -o sum_digits
