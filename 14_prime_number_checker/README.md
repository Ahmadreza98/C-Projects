# Prime Number Checker in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that checks whether a given integer is a **prime number**. It demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, and basic input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts an integer input from the user
- Checks if the number is prime using an optimized approach (up to the square root of the number)
- Handles invalid input and numbers less than or equal to 1
- Prints a clear message indicating whether the number is prime or not

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc prime_checker.c -o prime_checker
