# Fibonacci Series Generator in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that generates the **Fibonacci series** up to a user-specified number of terms. It demonstrates loops, arithmetic operations, and basic input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts a non-negative integer `N` from the user
- Generates the first `N` terms of the Fibonacci series
- Prints each term with its index
- Handles invalid input gracefully
- Simple iterative implementation using a `for` loop

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc fibonacci.c -o fibonacci
