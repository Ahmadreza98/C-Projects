# Palindrome Number Checker in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that checks whether an integer entered by the user is a **palindrome**. A palindrome number reads the same forwards and backwards. The program demonstrates loops, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts an integer input from the user
- Automatically handles negative numbers
- Uses a `while` loop to reverse the number
- Compares the reversed number with the original
- Prints whether the number is a palindrome or not
- Simple and efficient implementation

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc palindrome_checker.c -o palindrome_checker
