# Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) Calculator in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that calculates the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of two integers entered by the user. It demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, arithmetic operations, and input validation in C. The program uses the **Euclidean algorithm** for efficient computation.

---

## Features

- Accepts two integer inputs from the user
- Handles negative numbers automatically
- Uses the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD
- Handles the special case when both numbers are zero
- Prints the result clearly in the terminal

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc gcd_calculator.c -o gcd_calculator
