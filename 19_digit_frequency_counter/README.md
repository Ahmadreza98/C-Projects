## Overview

This project is a simple C program that counts the **frequency of a specific digit** in an integer entered by the user. It demonstrates loops, arithmetic operations, conditional statements, and input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts an integer input from the user
- Accepts a single digit (0–9) to count
- Handles negative numbers automatically
- Counts how many times the specified digit appears in the number
- Handles the special case when both the number and the digit are zero
- Prints the result clearly in the terminal

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc digit_frequency.c -o digit_frequency
