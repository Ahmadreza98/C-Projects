# Menu-Driven Calculator in C

## Overview

This project is a simple **menu-driven calculator** written in C. The program allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. It demonstrates functions, loops, conditional statements, and input validation in C.

## Features

- Performs the following arithmetic operations:
  - Addition (`+`)
  - Subtraction (`-`)
  - Multiplication (`x`)
  - Division (`/`) with zero-division check
- Menu-driven interface for repeated calculations
- Uses separate functions for each operation
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully
- Displays results with two decimal points for clarity

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions
