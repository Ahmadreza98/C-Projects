# Array Statistics Analyzer in C

## Overview

This project is a C program that analyzes a set of integers entered by the user and computes **maximum, minimum, and average values**. It demonstrates arrays, loops, functions, and input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts a user-defined number of integers (up to 100)
- Calculates the **maximum** value in the array
- Calculates the **minimum** value in the array
- Computes the **average** of all numbers
- Uses separate functions for maximum, minimum, and average calculations
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc array_statistics.c -o array_statistics
