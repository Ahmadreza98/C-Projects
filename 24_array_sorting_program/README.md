# Array Sorting Program in C (Ascending & Descending)

## Overview

This project is a C program that sorts an array of integers in either **ascending or descending order** using the **bubble sort algorithm**. It demonstrates arrays, loops, functions, and input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts up to 100 integers from the user
- Displays the array before sorting
- Sorts the array in:
  - **Ascending order**
  - **Descending order**
- Implements the bubble sort algorithm with an early exit optimization
- Displays the sorted array clearly
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc array_sort.c -o array_sort
