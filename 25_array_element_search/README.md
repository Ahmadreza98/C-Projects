# Array Element Search in C (Linear Search)

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that searches for an element in an array using **linear search**. The program demonstrates arrays, loops, conditional statements, and input validation in C.

> Note: Although the title mentions binary search, this program currently implements **linear search only**.

## Features

- Accepts up to 100 integers from the user
- Allows the user to enter a target element to search for
- Searches for the element using **linear search**
- Displays the index of the element if found
- Indicates if the element is not present
- Handles invalid inputs gracefully

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions
