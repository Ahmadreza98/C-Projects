# Binary Search in Sorted Array (C)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to perform a **binary search** on an array in C. Since binary search requires a sorted array, the program first sorts the input array in **ascending order** using the **bubble sort algorithm**, and then applies **binary search** to locate a target element.

This project highlights sorting, searching algorithms, functions, pointers, and input validation in C.

## Features

- Accepts up to 100 integer elements
- Sorts the array in ascending order before searching
- Searches for a given element using **binary search**
- Displays the index of the element if found
- Displays a clear message if the element is not found
- Uses separate functions for sorting, swapping, and searching
- Includes basic input validation

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C libraries (`stdio.h`, `stdbool.h`)
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using:

```bash
gcc binary_search.c -o binary_search
