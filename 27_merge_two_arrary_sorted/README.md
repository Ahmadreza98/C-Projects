# Merge Two Sorted Arrays in C

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to **merge two already sorted arrays** into a single sorted array using C. The implementation follows the classic **merge step of the merge sort algorithm**, making it efficient and easy to understand.

The project highlights array manipulation, pointer usage, function decomposition, and input validation.

---

## Features

- Accepts two sorted integer arrays from the user
- Merges both arrays into a single sorted array
- Maintains ascending order in the merged array
- Supports array sizes from 1 to 100
- Uses a dedicated merge function
- Includes basic input validation

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library (`stdio.h`)
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using:

```bash
gcc merge_sorted_arrays.c -o merge_sorted_arrays
