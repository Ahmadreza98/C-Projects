# Merge Sort Implementation in C

## Overview

This project implements the **Merge Sort algorithm** in C. Merge sort is a **divide-and-conquer** sorting algorithm that recursively divides an array into subarrays, sorts them, and then merges them back together in sorted order.

The project demonstrates recursion, array manipulation, temporary arrays, and algorithmic problem solving in C.

## Features

- Sorts an array of integers using **merge sort**
- Supports array sizes from 1 to 100
- Uses recursion for dividing the array
- Merges sorted subarrays efficiently
- Displays the array before and after sorting
- Includes input validation

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library (`stdio.h`)
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using:

```bash
gcc merge_sort.c -o merge_sort
