# Quick Sort Implementation in C

## Overview

This project implements the **Quick Sort algorithm** in C. Quick sort is a highly efficient **divide-and-conquer** sorting algorithm that selects a pivot element, partitions the array around the pivot, and recursively sorts the subarrays.

This implementation uses the **Lomuto partition scheme**, making the logic clear and educational.

## Features

- Sorts an array of integers using **Quick Sort**
- Supports array sizes from 1 to 100
- Uses recursion and in-place swapping
- Displays the array before and after sorting
- Includes input validation
- Modular design with separate functions

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library (`stdio.h`)
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using:

```bash
gcc quick_sort.c -o quick_sort
