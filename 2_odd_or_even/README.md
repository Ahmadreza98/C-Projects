## Features

- Accepts an integer from standard input
- Determines parity using the modulo (`%`) operator
- Uses a ternary operator for concise conditional logic
- Displays a clear result (`odd` or `even`) in the terminal

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows (with a compatible compiler)

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc odd_even.c -o odd_even
