# Counting Occurrences of Elements in Array (C)

## Overview

This project demonstrates how to **count the number of occurrences of a specific target value** in an integer array using the C programming language.

It focuses on:
- Array traversal
- Conditional comparison
- Counter-based frequency counting
- Input validation

This is a fundamental problem frequently used to build understanding of arrays and linear search techniques.

---

## Features

- Accepts a dynamic number of elements
- Stores user input in an array
- Counts how many times a target value appears
- Handles invalid input safely
- Clear and user-friendly console output

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (GCC recommended)
- Standard C library (`stdio.h`)
- Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using:

```bash
gcc count_occurrences.c -o count_occurrences
