# Factorial Calculator in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that calculates the **factorial** of a non-negative integer entered by the user. It demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, and input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Calculates factorial of any non-negative integer
- Handles invalid or negative input gracefully
- Uses a `for` loop for iterative calculation
- Displays the result clearly in the terminal

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc factorial.c -o factorial
