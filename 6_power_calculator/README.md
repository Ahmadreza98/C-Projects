# Power Calculator in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that calculates the **power** of a number. The user provides a base and an exponent, and the program computes the result using iterative multiplication. This project demonstrates loops, arithmetic operations, and basic console input/output in C.

---

## Features

- Computes the power of an integer base raised to a non-negative integer exponent
- Uses a `for` loop for iterative multiplication
- Simple command-line interaction
- Clear and readable output

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc power.c -o power
