# Sum of Numbers in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that calculates the **sum of all integers from 1 to a user-provided number**. It demonstrates the use of loops, conditional statements, input validation, and basic arithmetic in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts a non-negative integer from the user
- Computes the sum of all numbers from 1 up to the given number
- Uses a `for` loop for iterative summation
- Handles invalid or negative input gracefully
- Prints the result clearly in the terminal

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc sum_numbers.c -o sum_numbers
