# Maximum of Three Numbers in C

## Overview

This project is a simple C program that finds the **maximum number among three integers** entered by the user. It demonstrates loops, conditional statements, and input validation in C.

---

## Features

- Accepts three integer inputs from the user
- Determines the largest number among them
- Uses a `do-while` loop and conditional logic
- Handles invalid input gracefully
- Prints the result clearly in the terminal

---

## Requirements

- C compiler (e.g., `gcc`)
- Standard C library
- Compatible with Linux, macOS, and Windows

---

## Build Instructions

Compile the program using `gcc`:

```bash
gcc max_number.c -o max_number
